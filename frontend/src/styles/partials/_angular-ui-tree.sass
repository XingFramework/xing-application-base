//  As a combination of new styles, and override of defaults

// This mixin is itself a combination of mixins defined in framework/_angular-ui-tree.sass.
// You can customize by:
//   * Overriding rules
//   * Including only the sub-mixins you care about
//   * Removing this include entirely and writing new rules
