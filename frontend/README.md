# reasoning
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LRDesign/reasoning.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LRDesign/reasoning)

An Reasonable Setup for [aNGularjs](http://angularjs.org) projects. (...and
therefore "ReaSoniNG." Cool right? Yeah... we know. We'll try harder next
time.)

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/LRDesign/reasoning
$ cd reasoning
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower # optional if you don't mind
  putting ./node_modules/bin in your path)
$ npm install
$ bundle install #still required till we can switch to libsass
$ grunt bower:install #optional
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/reasoning/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy hacking!

## Purpose

`reasoning` is designed to speed the setup of new Angular JS projects by
collecting a set of framework choices in one place. It's intended also to be a
place where new discoveries and preferences ca be collected over time.  It
contains a best-practice directory structure to ensure code reusability and
maximum scalability.  `reasoning` also comes prepackaged with a set of best of
breed JavaScript and CSS tools, selected over time by LRD for best
productivity:
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/),
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/),
[Angular UI](http://angular-ui.github.io),
[Angular Resource](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource),
[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome),
[SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
[Singularity](http://singularity.gs/), and
[Sassy Buttons](http://jaredhardy.com/sassy-buttons/), and
[Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

Lastly, it contains a sophisticated [Grunt](http://gruntjs.org)-based build
system to ensure maximum productivity.  All you have to do is clone it and
start coding!

In general, the preference has been for small, well built components over
overarching frameworks (like Foundation or Bootstrap.) In this way, we'll be
able to replace things more easily as we discover better alternatives.

## Philosophy

The principal goal of `reasoning` is to set projects up for long-term
success.  So `reasoning` tries to follow best practices everywhere it can.
These are:

- Properly orchestrated modules to encourage drag-and-drop component re-use.
- The build system should work automagically, without involvement from the
  developer. It should do what needs to be done, while
  staying out of the way. Components should end up tested, linted, compiled,
  and minified, ready for use in a production environment.
- Integration with popular tools like Bower, Karma, and SASS.
- *Encourages* test-driven development. It's the only way to code.
- A directory structure that is cogent, meaningful to new team members, and
  supporting of the above points.
- Well-documented, to show new developers *why* things are set up the way they
  are.

### Overall Directory Structure

At a high level, the structure looks roughly like this:

```
reasoning/
  |- grunt-tasks/
  |- karma/
  |- src/
  |  |- app/
  |  |  |- <app logic>
  |  |- assets/
  |  |  |- <static files>
  |  |- common/
  |  |  |- <reusable code>
  |  |- less/
  |  |  |- main.less
  |- test/
     |- app/
     |- common/
  |- vendor/
  |  |- angular-bootstrap/
  |  |- bootstrap/
  |  |- placeholders/
  |- .bowerrc
  |- bower.json
  |- build.config.js
  |- Gruntfile.js
  |- module.prefix
  |- module.suffix
  |- package.json
```

What follows is a brief description of each entry, but most directories contain
their own `README.md` file with additional documentation, so browse around to
learn more.

- `karma/` - test configuration.
- `src/` - our application sources. [Read more &raquo;](src/README.md)
- `test/` - our application test files. [Read more &raquo;](test/README.md)
- `vendor/` - third-party libraries. [Bower](http://bower.io) will install
  packages here. Anything added to this directory will need to be manually added
  to `build.config.js` and `karma/karma-unit.js` to be picked up by the build
  system.
- `.bowerrc` - the Bower configuration file. This tells Bower to install
  components into the `vendor/` directory.
- `bower.json` - this is our project configuration for Bower and it contains the
  list of Bower dependencies we need.
- `build.config.js` - our customizable build settings; see "The Build System"
  below.
- `Gruntfile.js` - our build script; see "The Build System" below.
- `module.prefix` and `module.suffix` - our compiled application script is
  wrapped in these, which by default are used to place the application inside a
  self-executing anonymous function to ensure no clashes with other libraries.
- `package.json` - metadata about the app, used by NPM and our build script. Our
  NPM dependencies are listed here.

### Detailed Installation

This section provides a little more detailed understanding of what goes into
getting `reasoning` up and running. Though `reasoning` is really simple
to use, it might help to have an understanding of the tools involved here, like
Node.js and Grunt and Bower. If you're completely new to highly organized,
modern JavaScript development, take a few short minutes to read [this overview
of the tools](tools.md) before continuing with this section.

Okay, ready to go? Here it is:

`reasoning` uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.org) as its build system, so
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is required. Also, Grunt by default no longer comes
with a command-line utility and Karma and Bower must end up in your global path
for the build system to find it, so they must be installed independently. Once
you have Node.js installed, you can simply use `npm` to make it all happen:

```sh
$ npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
```

If you're on Linux (like I am) then throw `sudo` in front of that command.  If
you're on Windows, then you're on your own.

Next, you can either clone this repository using Git, download it as a zip file
from GitHub, or merge the branch into your existing repository. Assuming you're
starting from scratch, simply clone this repository using git:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/LRDesign/reasoning my-project-name
$ cd my-project-name
```

And then install the remaining build dependencies locally:

```sh
$ npm install
```

This will read the `dependencies` (empty by default) and the `devDependencies`
(which contains our build requirements) from `package.json` and install
everything needed into a folder called `node_modules/`.

There are many Bower packages used by `reasoning`, like Twitter Bootstrap
and Angular UI, which are listed in `bower.js`. To install them into the
`vendor/` directory, simply run:

```sh
$ bower install
```

In the future, should you want to add a new Bower package to your app, run the
`install` command:

```sh
$ bower install packagename --save-dev
```

The `--save-dev` flag tells Bower to add the package at its current version to
our project's `bower.js` file so should another developer download our
application (or we download it from a different computer), we can simply run the
`bower install` command as above and all our dependencies will be installed for
us. Neat!

Technically, `reasoning` is now ready to go.

However, prior to hacking on your application, you will want to modify the
`package.json` file to contain your project's information. Do not remove any
items from the `devDependencies` array as all are needed for the build process
to work.

To ensure your setup works, launch grunt:

```sh
$ grunt watch
```

The built files are placed in the `build/` directory by default. Open the
`build/index.html` file in your browser and check it out! Because everything is
compiled, no XHR requests are needed to retrieve templates, so until this needs
to communicate with your backend there is no need to run it from a web server.

`watch` is actually an alias of the `grunt-contrib-watch` that will first run a
partial build before watching for file changes. With this setup, any file that
changes will trigger only those build tasks necessary to bring the app up to
date. For example, when a template file changes, the templates are recompiled
and concatenated, but when a test/spec file changes, only the tests are run.
This allows the watch command to complete in a fraction of the time it would
ordinarily take.

In addition, if you're running a Live Reload plugin in your browser (see below),
you won't even have to refresh to see the changes! When the `watch` task detects
a file change, it will reload the page for you. Sweet.

When you're ready to push your app into production, just run the `compile`
command:

```sh
$ grunt compile
```

This will concatenate and minify your sources and place them by default into the
`bin/` directory. There will only be three files: `index.html`,
`your-app-name.js`, and `your-app-name.css`. All of the vendor dependencies like
Bootstrap styles and AngularJS itself have been added to them for super-easy
deploying. If you use any assets (`src/assets/`) then they will be copied to
`bin/` as is.

Lastly, a complete build is always available by simply running the default
task, which runs `build` and then `compile`:

```sh
$ grunt
```

### The Build System

The best way to learn about the build system is by familiarizing yourself with
Grunt and then reading through the heavily documented build script,
`Gruntfile.js`. But you don't need to do that to be very productive with
`reasoning`. What follows in this section is a quick introduction to the
tasks provided and should be plenty to get you started.

The driver of the process is the `delta` multi-task, which watches for file
changes using `grunt-contrib-watch` and executes one of nine tasks when a file
changes:

* `delta:gruntfile` - When `Gruntfile.js` changes, this task runs the linter
  (`jshint`) on that one file and reloads the configuration.
* `delta:assets` - When any file within `src/assets/` changes, all asset files
  are copied to `build/assets/`.
* `delta:html` - When `src/index.html` changes, it is compiled as a Grunt
  template, so script names, etc., are dynamically replaced with the correct
  values configured dynamically by Grunt.
* `delta:less` - When any `*.less` file within `src/` changes, the
  `src/less/main.less` file is linted and copied into
  `build/assets/reasoning.css`.
* `delta:jssrc` - When any JavaScript file within `src/` that does not end in
  `.spec.js` changes, all JavaScript sources are linted, all unit tests are run,
  and the all source files are re-copied to `build/src`.
* `delta:coffeesrc` - When any `*.coffee` file in `src/` that doesn't match
  `*.spec.coffee` changes, the Coffee scripts are compiled independently into
  `build/src` in a structure mirroring where they were in `src/` so it's easy to
  locate problems. For example, the file
  `src/common/titleService/titleService.coffee` is compiled to
  `build/src/common/titleService/titleService.js`.
* `delta:tpls` - When any `*.tpl.html` file within `src/` changes, all templates
  are put into strings in a JavaScript file (technically two, one for
  `src/common/` and another for `src/app/`) that will add the template to
  AngularJS's
  [`$templateCache`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$templateCache) so
  template files are part of the initial JavaScript payload and do not require
  any future XHR.  The template cache files are `build/template-app.js` and
  `build/template-common.js`.
* `delta:jsunit` - When any `*.spec.js` file in `src/` changes, the test files
  are linted and the unit tests are executed.
* `delta:coffeeunit` - When any `*.spec.coffee` file in `src/` changes, the test
  files are linted, compiled their tests executed.

As covered in the previous section, `grunt watch` will execute a full build
up-front and then run any of the aforementioned `delta:*` tasks as needed to
ensure the fastest possible build. So whenever you're working on your project,
start with:

```sh
$ grunt watch
```

And everything will be done automatically!

### Build vs. Compile

To make the build even faster, tasks are placed into two categories: build and
compile. The build tasks (like those we've been discussing) are the minimal
tasks required to run your app during development.

Compile tasks, however, get your app ready for production. The compile tasks
include concatenation, minification, compression, etc. These tasks take a little
bit longer to run and are not at all necessary for development so are not called
automatically during build or watch.

To initiate a full compile, you simply run the default task:

```sh
$ grunt
```

This will perform a build and then a compile. The compiled site - ready for
uploading to the server! - is located in `bin/`, taking a cue from
traditional software development. To test that your full site works as
expected, open the `bin/index.html` file in your browser. Voila!

### Live Reload!

`reasoning` also includes [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/), so you no
longer have to refresh your page after making changes! You need a Live Reload
browser plugin for this:

- Chrome - [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
- Firefox - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.8/LiveReload-2.0.8.xpi)
- Safari - [Download from Live Reload](http://download.livereload.com/2.0.9/LiveReload-2.0.9.safariextz)

Note that if you're using the Chrome version with `file://` URLs (as is the
default with `reasoning`) you need to tell Live Reload to allow it. Go to
`Menu -> Tools -> Extensions` and check the "Allow access to file URLs" box next
to the Live Reload plugin.

When you load your page, click the Live Reload icon in your toolbar and
everything should work magically. w00t!

If you'd prefer to not install a browser extension, then you must add the
following to the end of the `body` tag in `index.html`:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>
```

Boom!

### Use with Rails or other server-side frameworks

This section needs to be fleshed out but:

Basically there's a couple of snippets needs to be added to the assets pipeline
- e.g. the livereload piece, and it'd be nice to add Singularity's grid guide toggle.

The assets pipeline also takes the place of `grunt compile` - which also means
we haven't really been using it since the original fork, so it's considered
unsupported for the time being. Use at your own risk, there might be sharp
edges, if it breaks you get to keep both pieces.

[Subtree merging](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Subtree-Merging)

Our process up til now has been to do a subtree merge into an angular directory
in the Rails project, and set things up so that the angular/build directory is
in the pipeline's search path for building assets. This process itself needs
refinement and better documentation, especially the git part.

#### Adding Reasoning to a project

This will add the `reasoning` code to the current project in a client/ directory:
```
git remote add reasoning git@git.lrdesign.com:lrd/reasoning.git
git subtree add -P client/ reasoning master
```

#### Updating Reasoning
```
git subtree pull -P client/ reasoning master
```

#### Push changes to Reasoning
```
git subtree push -P client/ reasoning new_branch
```
Then issue a merge request on new_branch

#### Merging requests in Reasoning
Because reasoning will form the basis of other apps, merge requests need to be
cherry-picked back to master. This is a more complicated operation than bears
discussion here.
